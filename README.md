Advent of Code 2023 in Rust ðŸŽ„

## What's this?

My own solutions to [Advent Of Code 2023 puzzles][aoc_2023] in Rust.

## My approach

* No AI
* No copying/cheating... at first. I'll review other people's solutions if I get stuck as it's a learning opportunity ðŸ˜‰
* Simple (hopefully) idiomatic Rust
* Probably very little beyond a working solution; my time is limited and this is for fun
* Pure Rust where possible; I might use some Crates where necessary, but I'd rather learn the standard library right now

## Feedback

I would love feedback on what could be improved or made simpler, more idiomatic or faster.
